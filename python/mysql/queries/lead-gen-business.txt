-- 1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?
select sum(amount) from billing
where charged_datetime >= '2012/03/01' and charged_datetime < '2012/04/01';

-- 2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?
select sum(amount) from billing
where client_id=2;

-- 3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client with an id of 10 owns?
select domain_name from sites where client_id = 10;

-- 4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client with an id of 20?
select month(created_datetime) as month, count(site_id) from sites where client_id = 1 group by month;
select year(created_datetime) as year, count(site_id) from sites where client_id = 1 group by year;
select month(created_datetime) as month, count(site_id) from sites where client_id = 20 group by month;
select year(created_datetime) as year, count(site_id) from sites where client_id = 20 group by year;

-- 5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?
select sites.domain_name, count(leads.leads_id) from sites join leads on sites.site_id=leads.site_id
where sites.created_datetime >= '2011/01/01' and sites.created_datetime < '2011/02/15' group by sites.domain_name;

-- 6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?
select concat_ws(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, count(leads.leads_id) from clients 
join sites on clients.client_id = sites.client_id join leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
where leads.registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' and leads.registered_datetime < '2011/12/31'
group by client_name;

-- 7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?
select month(leads.registered_datetime) as month, concat_ws(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, count(leads.leads_id) from clients 
join sites on clients.client_id = sites.client_id join leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
where leads.registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' and leads.registered_datetime < '2011/7/1'
group by month, client_name;

-- 8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  
select clients.client_id, concat_ws(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, count(leads.leads_id) from clients 
join sites on clients.client_id = sites.client_id join leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
where leads.registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' and leads.registered_datetime < '2011/12/31'
group by clients.client_id;
-- Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.
select clients.client_id, concat_ws(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, sites.domain_name, count(leads.leads_id) from clients 
join sites on clients.client_id = sites.client_id join leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
group by sites.domain_name;

-- 9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.  First try this with integer month, second with month name.  A SELECT subquery will be needed for the second challenge.  Look at this for a hint.
select year(billing.charged_datetime) as billed_year, monthname(billing.charged_datetime) as billed_month, 
concat_ws(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, sum(billing.amount) from billing
join clients on clients.client_id = billing.client_id group by billed_year,billed_month;

-- 10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that all of the sites for each client are displayed in a single field. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
select concat_ws(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, group_concat(distinct sites.domain_name separator ';') as sites from clients
join sites on clients.client_id = sites.client_id group by client_name;
